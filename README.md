`npm run watcher` is an alias for `node_modules/.bin/gulp watch`

It will automatically compile `less` and inject scripts every time a file changes.

Builds app executable for your current platform and place it under `build/<platform>/`.

Inspired by Popcorn Time's use of peerflix module. Expanded on their idea.
